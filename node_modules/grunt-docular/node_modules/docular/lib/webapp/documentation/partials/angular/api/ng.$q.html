<div class="description"><p>A promise/deferred implementation inspired by <a href="https://github.com/kriskowal/q">Kris Kowal's Q</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises">The CommonJS Promise proposal</a> describes a promise as an
interface for interacting with an object that represents the result of an action that is
performed asynchronously, and may or may not be finished at any given point in time.</p>

<p>From the perspective of dealing with error handling, deferred and promise APIs are to
asynchronous programming what  <code class="plain">try</code> ,  <code class="plain">catch</code>  and  <code class="plain">throw</code>  keywords are to synchronous programming.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  // for the purpose of this example let's assume that variables REPLACEME3 and REPLACEME4 are
  // available in the current lexical scope (they could have been injected or passed in).

  function asyncGreet(name) {
    var deferred = $q.defer();

    setTimeout(function() {
      // since this fn executes async in a future turn of the event loop, we need to wrap
      // our code into an $apply call so that the model changes are properly observed.
      scope.$apply(function() {
        if (okToGreet(name)) {
          deferred.resolve('Hello, ' + name + '!');
        } else {
          deferred.reject('Greeting ' + name + ' is not allowed.');
        }
      });
    }, 1000);

    return deferred.promise;
  }

  var promise = asyncGreet('Robin Hood');
  promise.then(function(greeting) {
    alert('Success: ' + greeting);
  }, function(reason) {
    alert('Failed: ' + reason);
  });
</pre>

<p>At first it might not be obvious why this extra complexity is worth the trouble. The payoff
comes in the way of
<a href="https://github.com/kriskowal/uncommonjs/blob/master/promises/specification.md">guarantees that promise and deferred APIs make</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally the promise api allows for composition that is very hard to do with the
traditional callback (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style">CPS</a>) approach.
For more on this please see the <a href="https://github.com/kriskowal/q">Q documentation</a> especially the
section on serial or parallel joining of promises.</p>

<h1 id="thedeferredapi">The Deferred API</h3>

<p>A new instance of deferred is constructed by calling  <code class="plain">$q.defer()</code> .</p>

<p>The purpose of the deferred object is to expose the associated Promise instance as well as APIs
that can be used for signaling the successful or unsuccessful completion of the task.</p>

<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>

<ul>
<li> <code class="plain">resolve(value)</code>  – resolves the derived promise with the  <code class="plain">value</code> . If the value is a rejection
constructed via  <code class="plain">$q.reject</code> , the promise will be rejected instead.</li>
<li> <code class="plain">reject(reason)</code>  – rejects the derived promise with the  <code class="plain">reason</code> . This is equivalent to
resolving it with a rejection constructed via  <code class="plain">$q.reject</code> .</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Properties</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>promise –  <code class="plain">{Promise}</code>  – promise object associated with this deferred.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="thepromiseapi">The Promise API</h3>

<p>A new promise instance is created when a deferred instance is created and can be retrieved by
calling  <code class="plain">deferred.promise</code> .</p>

<p>The purpose of the promise object is to allow for interested parties to get access to the result
of the deferred task when it completes.</p>

<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>

<ul>
<li> <code class="plain">then(successCallback, errorCallback)</code>  – regardless of when the promise was or will be resolved
or rejected calls one of the success or error callbacks asynchronously as soon as the result
is available. The callbacks are called with a single argument the result or rejection reason.</p>

<p>This method <em>returns a new promise</em> which is resolved or rejected via the return value of the
 <code class="plain">successCallback</code>  or  <code class="plain">errorCallback</code> .</p></li>
<li> <code class="plain">always(callback)</code>  – allows you to observe either the fulfillment or rejection of a promise,
but to do so without modifying the final value. This is useful to release resources or do some
clean-up that needs to be done whether the promise was rejected or resolved. See the <a href="https://github.com/kriskowal/q/wiki/API-Reference#promisefinallycallback">full
specification</a> for
more information.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="chainingpromises">Chaining promises</h3>

<p>Because calling  <code class="plain">then</code>  api of a promise returns a new derived promise, it is easily possible
to create a chain of promises:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  promiseB = promiseA.then(function(result) {
    return result + 1;
  });

  // promiseB will be resolved immediately after promiseA is resolved and its value will be
  // the result of promiseA incremented by 1
</pre>

<p>It is possible to create chains of any length and since a promise can be resolved with another
promise (which will defer its resolution further), it is possible to pause/defer resolution of
the promises at any point in the chain. This makes it possible to implement powerful apis like
$http's response interceptors.</p>

<h1 id="differencesbetweenkriskowalsqanddq">Differences between Kris Kowal's Q and $q</h3>

<p>There are three main differences:</p>

<ul>
<li>$q is integrated with the <a href="documentation/angular/api/ng.$rootScope.Scope"><code>ng.$rootScope.Scope</code></a> Scope model observation
mechanism in angular, which means faster propagation of resolution or rejection into your
models and avoiding unnecessary browser repaints, which would result in flickering UI.</li>
<li>$q promises are recognized by the templating engine in angular, which means that in templates
you can treat promises attached to a scope as if they were the resulting values.</li>
<li><p>Q has many more features than $q, but that comes at a cost of bytes. $q is tiny, but contains
all the important functionality needed for common async tasks.</p>

<h1 id="testing">Testing</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
   it('should simulate promise', inject(function($q, $rootScope) {
     var deferred = $q.defer();
     var promise = deferred.promise;
     var resolvedValue;

     promise.then(function(value) { resolvedValue = value; });
     expect(resolvedValue).toBeUndefined();

     // Simulate resolving of promise
     deferred.resolve(123);
     // Note that the 'then' function does not get called synchronously.
     // This is because we want the promise API to always be async, whether or not
     // it got called synchronously or asynchronously.
     expect(resolvedValue).toBeUndefined();

     // Propagate promise resolution to 'then' functions using $apply().
     $rootScope.$apply();
     expect(resolvedValue).toEqual(123);
   });

<li><h3 id="reject">reject(reason)</h3>
<div class="reject"><p>Creates a promise that is resolved as rejected with the specified  <code class="plain">reason</code> . This api should be
used to forward rejection in a chain of promises. If you are dealing with the last promise in
a promise chain, you don't need to worry about it.</p>

<p>When comparing deferreds/promises to the familiar behavior of try/catch/throw, think of
 <code class="plain">reject</code>  as the  <code class="plain">throw</code>  keyword in JavaScript. This also means that if you "catch" an error via
a promise error callback and you want to forward the error to the promise derived from the
current promise, you have to "rethrow" the error by returning a rejection constructed via
 <code class="plain">reject</code> .</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  promiseB = promiseA.then(function(result) {
    // success: do something and resolve promiseB
    //          with the old or a new result
    return result;
  }, function(reason) {
    // error: handle the error if possible and
    //        resolve promiseB with newPromiseOrValue,
    //        otherwise forward the rejection to promiseB
    if (canHandle(reason)) {
     // handle the error and recover
     return newPromiseOrValue;
    }
    return $q.reject(reason);
