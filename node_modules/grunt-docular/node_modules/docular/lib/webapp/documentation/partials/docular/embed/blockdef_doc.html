<h1><code ng:non-bindable="">Documentation In "Doc" Files</code>
<span class="hint"></span>

<div><p>First remember how to <a href="/documentation/docular/docularconfigure/sections">point Docular at your doc files</a>. Next, understand the main differences between script files and "doc" files.</p>

<h4 id="docfilesendwithdoc">"Doc" Files End With ".doc"</h5>

<p>The first obvious difference is that these files must end with a ".doc" file extension. This allows you to mix your ".doc" files with script files within the same directory and have Docular pick them out easily.</p>

<h4 id="docfilesonlyhavedocumentation">"Doc" Files only Have Documentation</h5>

<p>The most important difference is that "doc" files contain no code and are meant exclusively for storing documentation. This means documentation does not need to reside within comment blocks.</p>

<h4 id="docfilesaregreatforoverviews">"Doc" Files are Great for "Overviews"</h5>

<p>"Doc" files are perfect for storing "overview" type documentation, tutorials, and introductions. Most of the documentation you are reading here was made within "doc" files.</p>

<h3 id="howdocfilesareparsed">How "Doc" Files are Parsed</h4>

<p>When "Doc" files are read, the parser looks for a <a href="/documentation/docular/basics/identifier">document identifier</a>. This signals the begginning of a documentation section. All other <a href="/documentation/docular/basics/fields">documentation fields</a> that are encountered are parsed and attached to this documentation object.</p>

<p>This process continues until the end of the file is reached or until a new <a href="/documentation/docular/basics/identifier">document identifier</a> is discovered. At this point either the process ends or the start of a new documentation object begins.</p>

<h3 id="sampledocumentationwithinadocfile">Sample Documentation Within A "Doc" File</h4>

<p>Here is an example of Docular documentation within a "doc" file:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
&#64;doc overview
&#64;id intro
&#64;name Intro To My Code
&#64;description #Welcome to My Code

## Why My Code is Awesome

1. Naming is clear
2. It is well organized
3. It is well documented ;-)

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>So here are a few points to note:</p>

<ol>
<li>"Doc" files should end with the extension ".doc"</li>
<li>Documentation is not within comment blocks</li>
<li>"Doc" files are perfect for creating overviews, tutorials, splash pages.</li>
</ol>
