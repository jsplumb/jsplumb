JSDoc 3 is intended to be\nan upgrade to JsDoc Toolkit (JSDoc 2).\n\nWant to contribute to JSDoc? Please read `CONTRIBUTING.md`.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nUse git to clone the [official JSDoc repository](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc):\n\n    git clone git@github.com:jsdoc3/jsdoc.git\n\nAlternatively, you can download a .zip file for the\n[latest development version](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc/archive/master.zip)\nor a [previous release](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc/tags).\n\nYou can also install JSDoc within a Node.js project's `node_modules` directory\nusing npm. To install the latest development version, change directories to your\nNode.js project, then run the following command:\n\n    npm install git://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc.git\n\nOr to install JSDoc globally:\n\n    npm install -g git://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc.git\n\n**Note**: Although you can install JSDoc with npm, JSDoc does not currently run\non Node.js.\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nThis example assumes that your working directory is the JSDoc application base\ndirectory:\n\n    ./jsdoc yourSourceCodeFile.js\n\nFor information about the supported command-line options, use the `--help`\noption.\n\n    ./jsdoc --help\n\nGenerated documentation will appear in the folder specified by the\n`--destination` option, or in a folder named \"out\" by default.\n\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\nJSDoc 3 uses the Mozilla Rhino engine, which requires Java. JSDoc 3 is known to\nwork with version 1.6.0_24 of Java.\n\nJSDoc 3 uses advanced features in Mozilla Rhino that are only available in or\nafter version 1.7R3. In addition, JSDoc 3 requires several customizations to the\nstandard Rhino distribution. The customized version of Rhino is included with\nJSDoc.\n\nIn rare cases, users may have their Java CLASSPATH configured to override the\nincluded Rhino and point to an older version of Rhino instead. If this is the\ncase, simply correct the CLASSPATH to remove the older Rhino. (On OS X, you may\nneed to remove the file `~/Library/Java/Extensions/js.jar`.)\n\nThe version of Rhino distributed with JSDoc 3 can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/hegemonic/rhino\n\n\nDebugging\n---------\n\nRhino is not always very friendly when it comes to reporting errors in\nJavaScript. Luckily, it comes with a full-on debugger included that can be much\nmore useful than a simple stack trace. To invoke JSDoc with the debugger, run\nthe following command on Windows:\n\n    jsdoc --debug\n\nOr on OS X, Linux, and other POSIX-compliant systems:\n\n    ./jsdoc --debug\n\nIf you can't get the short-form commands to work, try invoking Java directly:\n\n    java -cp lib/js.jar org.mozilla.javascript.tools.debugger.Main \\\n    -debug -modules node_modules -modules rhino -modules lib -modules . \\\n    jsdoc.js your/script.js\n\nNote: `--debug` must be the first argument to the short-form command.\n\nThis will open a debugging window. Click Debug > Break on Exceptions, then click\nRun. If there is an error, you should see exactly where it is in the source\ncode.\n\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\nProject Documentation: <http://usejsdoc.org/> (under development)  \nProject Documentation Source: <https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc3.github.com>  \nJSDoc User's Group: <http://groups.google.com/group/jsdoc-users>  \nJSDoc 3 Ant Task: <https://github.com/jannon/jsdoc3-ant-task>  \nProject Announcements: <http://twitter.com/jsdoc3>\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nJSDoc 3 is copyright (c) 2011-2012 Michael Mathews <micmath@gmail.com>.\n\nJSDoc 3 is free software, licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
