                <h4>STATE MACHINE</h4>
                <p>Nodes are connected with the StateMachine connector.</p>
                <p>Endpoints are located with 'Continuous' anchors, which are anchors whose location is calculated based on the location of all other connected elements, and which guarantee a unique endpoint per connection.
                </p>                                
                <p>Click and drag new Connections from the orange div in each element; the main elements in the UI are configured to be Connection targets. You can drag from one of these divs onto its parent element to create a 'loopback' connection. Each element supports up to 5 Connections.</p>
                <p>Click on a Connection to delete it.</p>
                <p>This demonstration uses jsPlumb 1.6.0, jQuery 1.9.0 and jQuery UI 1.9.2.For touch support, jQuery Touch Punch is used.</p>
