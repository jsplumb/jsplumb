These functions work with Bezier\ncurves of arbitrary degree.\n\n- functions are all in the 'jsBezier' namespace.\n\n- all input points should be in the format {x:.., y:..}. all output points are in this format too.\n\n- all input curves should be in the format [ {x:.., y:..}, {x:.., y:..}, {x:.., y:..}, {x:.., y:..} ]\n\n- 'location' as used as an input here refers to a decimal in the range 0-1 inclusive, which indicates a point some proportion along the length\nof the curve.  location as output has the same format and meaning.\n\n\nFunction List:\n--------------\n\ndistanceFromCurve(point, curve)\n\n\tCalculates the distance that the given point lies from the given Bezier.  Note that it is computed relative to the center of the Bezier,\nso if you have stroked the curve with a wide pen you may wish to take that into account!  The distance returned is relative to the values\nof the curve and the point - it will most likely be pixels.\n\ngradientAtPoint(curve, location)\n\n\tCalculates the gradient to the curve at the given location, as a decimal between 0 and 1 inclusive.\n\ngradientAtPointAlongCurveFrom (curve, location)\n\n\tCalculates the gradient at the point on the given curve that is 'distance' units from location.\n\nnearestPointOnCurve(point, curve)\n\n\tCalculates the nearest point to the given point on the given curve.  The return value of this is a JS object literal, containing both the\npoint's coordinates and also the 'location' of the point (see above), for example:  { point:{x:551,y:150}, location:0.263365 }.\n\npointOnCurve(curve, location)\n\n\tCalculates the coordinates of the point on the given Bezier curve at the given location.\n\npointAlongCurveFrom(curve, location, distance)\n\n\tCalculates the coordinates of the point on the given curve that is 'distance' units from location.  'distance' should be in the same coordinate\nspace as that used to construct the Bezier curve.  For an HTML Canvas usage, for example, distance would be a measure of pixels.\n\nlocationAlongCurveFrom(curve, location, distance)\n\n\tCalculates the location on the given curve that is 'distance' units from location.  'distance' should be in the same coordinate\nspace as that used to construct the Bezier curve.  For an HTML Canvas usage, for example, distance would be a measure of pixels.\n\nperpendicularToCurveAt(curve, location, length, distance)\n\n\tCalculates the perpendicular to the given curve at the given location.  length is the length of the line you wish for (it will be centered\non the point at 'location'). distance is optional, and allows you to specify a point along the path from the given location as the center of\nthe perpendicular returned.  The return value of this is an array of two points: [ {x:...,y:...}, {x:...,y:...} ].",

These functions work with Bezier\ncurves of arbitrary degree.\n\n- functions are all in the 'jsBezier' namespace.\n\n- all input points should be in the format {x:.., y:..}. all output points are in this format too.\n\n- all input curves should be in the format [ {x:.., y:..}, {x:.., y:..}, {x:.., y:..}, {x:.., y:..} ]\n\n- 'location' as used as an input here refers to a decimal in the range 0-1 inclusive, which indicates a point some proportion along the length\nof the curve.  location as output has the same format and meaning.\n\n\nFunction List:\n--------------\n\ndistanceFromCurve(point, curve)\n\n\tCalculates the distance that the given point lies from the given Bezier.  Note that it is computed relative to the center of the Bezier,\nso if you have stroked the curve with a wide pen you may wish to take that into account!  The distance returned is relative to the values\nof the curve and the point - it will most likely be pixels.\n\ngradientAtPoint(curve, location)\n\n\tCalculates the gradient to the curve at the given location, as a decimal between 0 and 1 inclusive.\n\ngradientAtPointAlongCurveFrom (curve, location)\n\n\tCalculates the gradient at the point on the given curve that is 'distance' units from location.\n\nnearestPointOnCurve(point, curve)\n\n\tCalculates the nearest point to the given point on the given curve.  The return value of this is a JS object literal, containing both the\npoint's coordinates and also the 'location' of the point (see above), for example:  { point:{x:551,y:150}, location:0.263365 }.\n\npointOnCurve(curve, location)\n\n\tCalculates the coordinates of the point on the given Bezier curve at the given location.\n\npointAlongCurveFrom(curve, location, distance)\n\n\tCalculates the coordinates of the point on the given curve that is 'distance' units from location.  'distance' should be in the same coordinate\nspace as that used to construct the Bezier curve.  For an HTML Canvas usage, for example, distance would be a measure of pixels.\n\nlocationAlongCurveFrom(curve, location, distance)\n\n\tCalculates the location on the given curve that is 'distance' units from location.  'distance' should be in the same coordinate\nspace as that used to construct the Bezier curve.  For an HTML Canvas usage, for example, distance would be a measure of pixels.\n\nperpendicularToCurveAt(curve, location, length, distance)\n\n\tCalculates the perpendicular to the given curve at the given location.  length is the length of the line you wish for (it will be centered\non the point at 'location'). distance is optional, and allows you to specify a point along the path from the given location as the center of\nthe perpendicular returned.  The return value of this is an array of two points: [ {x:...,y:...}, {x:...,y:...} ].",
